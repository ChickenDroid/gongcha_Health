## üìÉ Libraries used
*   [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/) - Previously known as 'Android support Library'
*   [CircleIndicator](https://github.com/ongakuer/CircleIndicator) - use it because it is more beautiful than making it myself.
*   [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView) - A flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set.
*   [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - for loading and caching images
*   [FancyGifDialog-Android](https://github.com/Shashank02051997/FancyGifDialog-Android) - Make your native android Dialog Fancy and Gify (excellent library but setmessage is not worked (bug))
*   [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/download)(In "1boon," one of the sites provided by Kakao, the image and title of the home training section are crawled and displayed in the recyclerview.)
